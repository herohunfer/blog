Typical Criteria for testing a browser:
* reponse time
* throughput
* resource utilization
* maximum load that system can bear

Typical approach to ask testing question:
5 W: Who, What, Where, When, Why
1. Who will use it
2. What they will do with it
3. Where (on which) it should be used? Where is it applied for?
4. When it should stay functional? When it should not?
5. Why?
